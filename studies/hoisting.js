// How are variables hoisted in JavaScript?
// How are function declarations hoisted? How are function expressions hoisted?
// What is the JS Interpreter 
/*
 * Hoisting 
 *
 * Hoisting is the process where the js intereter loads VARIABLE DECLARATIONS and FUNCTION FUNCTION DECLARATIONS to memory 
 * BEFORE executing the code
 *
 * NOTE: JS Interpreter is what reads JavaScript code to execute it by
 * and publish it for humans to see and interact with

// 1. Global Scope //
/*
 * Think of global scope as the parent scope or the omnipresent scope. It's the largest scope and contains all other scopes inside of it.
 * Everything in the global scope is accessible from the local and block scope. Way to think of it as a parent scope it passes down all genes or properties to the children scopes OR it is omnipresent so it is present in all scopes
